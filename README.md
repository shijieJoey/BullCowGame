**About The BullCowGame**:

You will be given a random English word and its length.

And you will give your guess of this word in each round.

If you get the word right, you win the game!

Otherwise, we will tell you how much Bulls or Cows you have in this guess.

A Bull score means you have guessed one correct letter at the right place.

A Cow score means you have guessed one correct letter at the wrong place.

But if you run out your lives, you lose this game!
